Making final project for the subject Time Series

The analyze using time series is made on Booking Holdings Inc. data. The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance in the period from 1st January 2011 until 1st December 2022, considering monthly data.
The analysis begin by checking how the data is structured, and after we dive deeper into methods used for making time series analysis. The exploratory analysis includes checking if there are some patterns in the data, such as having trend, seasonality, and irregular fluctuations, if the series is stationary or not. Understanding this characteristic is crucial for selecting appropriate analytical approaches.
The essential steps in the time series analysis are data processing techniques, handling missing values, detrending the time series, eliminating seasonality or noise
if there is some to be sure that we will have good results before applying any model to it. After that, we are applying analytical models such as autocorrelation and decomposition, and finally discussing popular techniques such as ARIMA models and exponential smoothing models. These methods capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, allowing for reliable forecasting and anomaly detection.
